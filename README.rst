=========================
Django elFinder connector
=========================

This application aims to provide easy integration between Django and elFinder_.

.. _elFinder: http://elfinder.org/

elFinder is a jQuery-based file browser which uses a server-side connector/API
to request information about files and directories. The default connector PHP
scripts give direct access to the server's file system. This application uses
Django models as the backend for File/Directory storage. 

This is a work in progress, and does not provide complete support for all
elFinder features.
